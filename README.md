# NQueensProblem

The N-Queens problem involves placing n number of queens on an n by n chess board so that none of the queens are in the same column or row. The problem for an 8 by 8 board is shown here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle.

My program uses recursion to go through every different combination the board can have marking off the columns and rows and then counting the number of valid answers. The chess board is represented by a two dimentional array.
The program can take inputs up to n = 15.

Sample Input and Output
```
Enter the number of queens: 15
The number of valid arrangements is 2279184

```
